# Gander

## About the Project
Inspired by the musical Come From Away, Gander will be a ludonarrative game that captures the inspiring, yet still relatively unknown stories of residents of Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11 when a small town in the middle of nowhere became a light in the dark when it welcomed 6,700 frightened passagers whose planes had been diverted because of a terrorist attack on US soil.
