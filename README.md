# Gander

## About the Project
Inspired by the musical Come From Away, Gander will be a ludonarrative game that captures the inspiring, yet still relatively unknown stories of residents of Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11 when a small town became a light in the dark and welcomed 6,700 passagers from around the world who had nowhere to go after their planes had been diverted following the terrorist attack.
